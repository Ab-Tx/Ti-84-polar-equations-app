# Ti-84-polar-equations-app
This repo provides three applications for the Ti-84 graphic calculator that may help out when solving equations involving Polar numbers and also converting between Rectangular and Polar form.

- "PolOps" app allows you to enter up to 5 numbers in polar form (you'll be asked ot enter the absolute value and the angle separately) and afterwards do operations with these (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc..).
  - When you execute this program on your calculator you will be asked to enter a number (press enter once you insert it) and then you'll be asked to enter the angle (press enter once you insert it);

  - After inserting the first polar number the app will show you the number you've entered and the process will repeat just so you can insert a second number;

  - After inserting a second number you'll be asked if you want to add another number. 
        If you write "1" and press enter you'll be able to add another number;

  - If you press "0" the app will list the numbers you've entered. These numbers will be associated with the A,B,C,D and E variables of your calculator.
    In order to perform operations just use the variables instead of the numbers (Press "ALPHA" + "AnyVariablekey", where "AnyVariablekey" is the key associated with the variable you want to use);

  - After writing the operation you want to perform press enter, the calculator will show you the result and ask you if you want to do another operation;

  -If you press "1" the variable values will be listed again and you'll be able to enter another operation. If you press "0" the app execution will end, the values you entered will still be on the variables.
  
  
- "Ret2Pol" app will convret a number in Rectangular form to Polar form. (The number inserted will be saved on the variable "B" afterwards)

- "Pol2Ret" app will convert a number in Polar form to Rectangular form. (The number inserted will be saved on the variable "A" afterwards)

# How to send apps to your calculator
In order to send apps to your calculator you need to connect your calculator to your computer using an adequate cable. The calculator simply needs to be turned on to receive the apps.

In your computer you'll need the "TI Connect CE" application. This application ca be download from the Texas Instruments website. 
Just search for "TI Connect CE" and you'll find it right away.

More detailed instructions on how to send apps to your calculator can be found online in various platforms.
